# ProceduralTerrainGeneration

#About
This project is being created as a hobby project with the goal to create huge worlds without unloading anything in view of the player and instead get rid of detail of the terrain as you get further away. After this is created it may be incorperated into a game with an undecided theme and style.

#How to use
- To use this add the scripts to your unity assets
- Create a new empty object in your scene
- Drag the script into the new object
- Change the settings of the script to your liking in the inspector

#0.1.0.1
- Added ability to create terrain of any size with sudo-random heights for each vertex

#0.2.0.2
- Added ability to create an array of vertices more detailed than before
- Unable to create mesh with new detailed vertex creation
